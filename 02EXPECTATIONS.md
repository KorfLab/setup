Work-Life Balance in Academic Science
=====================================

Thoughts on the problems of being a scientist in academia.

Fast, Cheap, Reliable
---------------------

There is a saying when it comes to race cars: "fast, cheap, reliable: pick
two". There is a recognition that you can't have everything.

In Science, we don't say that. The sentiment is more like "intelligent,
creative, self-motivated, hard-working, independent, collaborative,
disciplined, flexible, reliable, accountable, personable: choose (all) eleven".

+ Intelligent - you can solve the problems that are in front of you
+ Creative - you can find new problems to solve
+ Self-motivated - nobody has to tell you to show up for work
+ Hard-working - you work many hours
+ Independent - you don't need others to succeed
+ Collaborative - you recognize success requires others, and welcome them
+ Disciplined - you can behave precisely as required
+ Flexible - you make room for difficulties
+ Reliable - people can count on you to show up or deliver on time
+ Accountable - you take credit for your failures
+ Personable - you are likable as a person and co-worker

It's unfair to be expected to be good at everything, and yet many scientists
beat themselves up because they aren't. Give yourself the breathing room you
would give to others. You don't have to be an A+ or even A- in all of these.
But try not to have an F in any of them.


Work Ethic
----------

How hard does one _need_ to work? Partly, that depends on your future plans.

Back when I was in graduate school, everyone had the same goal: become a
professor. That's a little unrealistic. There aren't that many jobs for
professors. All the professors you know right now worked really hard as
graduate students, and even harder as post-docs because they had to. It wasn't
possible to become a professor unless you were working some evenings and
weekends because that's what everyone else on your path was doing. Is that
still true today? Probably. Is it unhealthy for future professors to work 60
hours per week? Probably. Is this a form of academic hazing? Probably.
Ultimately, if you have designs on becoming a professor, you might need to work
60 hours per week because your competition is doing just that. On the plus
side, being a professor is a pretty great job most of the time and I have a
hard time imagining myself doing something else.

What if you want to be a staff scientist job in an industry setting? If the
company is well-established, you might end up in a 40 hour work week with HR
telling you not to work more. However, in a start-up you might be working
harder than you would trying to become a professor.

My dream is that my graduate students work at least 40 hours per week because
they can't help it. They just love research that much. If you don't love it,
it's' probably because you haven't tasted success enough. Part of my job is
providing opportunities to be successful. Part of your job is taking advantage
of those opportunities. If you don't love graduate school, we need to change
something.


Researcher Effectiveness Rating
===============================

Your RER is a measure of how well you are playing the Bioinformatics Researcher
Game in the Korf Lab. This is a kind of self-assessment. If you want a high
RER, you should do the following:

+ Be more proactive than reactive or non-active
+ Be interactive and collaborative with other members of the lab
+ Follow best practices in your computer environment
